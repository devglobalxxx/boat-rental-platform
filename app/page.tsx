  { name: 'James R.',      location: 'London',    rating: 5, text: 'We chartered an Azimut 50 out of Puerto Banús for my wife\'s fortieth birthday. Twelve guests, eight hours, one perfect day. The booking took less than ten minutes. Our skipper — a local who has sailed this coast for twenty years — took us to three anchoring spots that don\'t exist on any tourist map. We\'ve already booked again for next August.' },
  { name: 'Sophie & Marc', location: 'Amsterdam', rating: 5, text: 'As people who have used traditional brokers before, BoatHire24 is a completely different world. Everything is on screen: the real boat, the real price, the real availability. We found a catamaran in Ibiza, booked the same afternoon, and sailed two days later. Zero email chains. Zero spreadsheets. Zero surprises. The boat was exactly as advertised.' },
  { name: 'Aoife K.',      location: 'Dublin',    rating: 5, text: 'I was nervous booking a boat online for the first time — visions of turning up to a marina and finding nothing there. The verification badges, the real photographs, and the full price transparency before I entered my card number made all the difference. The whole experience, from booking to mooring back up, was genuinely outstanding.' },

const FAQS = [
  { q: 'Is a skipper always included?',         a: 'Yes, always. Every booking made through BoatHire24 includes a licensed, insured skipper as standard. We do not offer bareboat (self-sail) charters. This protects every guest, keeps every host covered under their maritime insurance, and ensures local knowledge comes with every charter.' },
  { q: 'What happens if the weather is bad?',   a: 'Your skipper begins monitoring forecasts 72 hours before departure. If sustained wind exceeds Force 6, they will recommend postponing. BoatHire24\'s weather policy provides a full credit or refund in these circumstances — no arguments, no fees. We would rather you sail on a beautiful day than a dangerous one.' },
  { q: 'What should I bring on a charter?',     a: 'SPF 50 sunscreen, a wide-brim hat, soft-sole non-marking shoes, a light windproof layer for the return leg, and a waterproof phone case. Most boats provide towels and snorkel equipment — check the amenities tab on each listing. The skipper can arrange food and drinks if requested in advance.' },
  { q: 'How far ahead should I book?',          a: 'For peak season — June through September — in popular destinations like Marbella and Ibiza, we recommend four to eight weeks in advance. Shoulder season has more availability and lower prices. Use the Instant Book filter to find vessels that confirm today.' },
  { q: 'How are my payments protected?',        a: 'All payments are processed by Stripe and held in escrow until 24 hours after your charter. If your host cancels for any reason, the full amount returns automatically within five to seven business days. BoatHire24\'s dispute team handles anything more complex. We never touch your card details directly.' },
  { q: 'Can I bring my dog?',                   a: 'Many hosts genuinely love welcoming dogs aboard. Use the Pet Friendly filter on the search page, or message the host before booking — some breeds or sizes may need individual agreement. The final decision always rests with the boat owner, and we ask all guests to respect that.' },

BoatHire24 turns idle marina days into income — without changing your schedule or your relationship with the vessel. You set the dates you want to share and the dates you want to keep. We handle everything else: guest communication, payment processing, and all booking logistics from enquiry to confirmation.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '16px', lineHeight: 1.75, color: 'rgba(244,244,242,0.65)', marginBottom: '16px' }}>More than 800 boat owners across 48 destinations already use BoatHire24 to manage their charter income. The average active host earns between €3,000 and €6,000 per month during peak season — with some high-demand vessels generating over €15,000 in a single July. Your earnings depend on your boat, your availability, and your location.</p>

You pay a 15% commission only when a booking is confirmed and the guest boards. That fee covers Stripe payment processing, guest insurance, and access to BoatHire24&apos;s 24/7 operations support. Connect your bank account via Stripe Express, set your availability calendar, and receive your first booking enquiry within days of going live. Whether you have one Sunseeker or an entire fleet, BoatHire24 is built to grow with your operation.</p>

              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-5" style={{ color: 'rgba(244,244,242,0.60)' }}>
                The photographs on every BoatHire24 listing were taken by a member of our team or a verified partner
                photographer — never stock imagery, never borrowed from a sister vessel. The specifications were
                checked against the vessel's technical documentation. The capacity figure reflects the vessel's
                actual certified limit, not a sales estimate. What you see on the listing is the boat you will
                board on the day of your charter. We stake our reputation on that guarantee.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-3" style={{ color: '#f4f4f2' }}>Your skipper is genuinely qualified.</h3>
              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: 'rgba(244,244,244,0.60)' }}>
                Before any skipper is permitted to take bookings through BoatHire24, we verify their coastal or
                offshore qualification with the issuing maritime authority, confirm their insurance is current
                and valid for the vessel class they are operating, and check that their experience profile
                matches the routes they are offering. We repeat this verification annually. A BoatHire24 skipper
                badge is not a courtesy title — it represents a genuine compliance check that most charter
                platforms do not perform at all.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-3" style={{ color: '#f4f4f2' }}>You will not be surprised by the price.</h3>
              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed mb-5" style={{ color: 'rgba(244,244,242,0.60)' }}>
                Hidden fees are the most common complaint in the charter industry. A listing advertises €400
                for a half-day. The guest arrives and discovers a €60 fuel surcharge, a €30 port fee, and a
                €20 &quot;cleaning deposit.&quot; The total was never €400. On BoatHire24, the listing price is
                the all-inclusive price. No service fees added at checkout, no additional charges at the
                dock, no surcharges added after booking, and no &quot;extras&quot; that were not disclosed
                in the listing. The price we show is the price you pay.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-3" style={{ color: '#f4f4f2' }}>If something goes wrong, we are responsible.</h3>
              <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed" style={{ color: 'rgba(244,244,242,0.60)' }}>
                Charter platforms that act purely as directories disclaim all responsibility when things go wrong.
                BoatHire24 does not. Our operations team is reachable by phone and WhatsApp from the moment you board
                until the moment you step back onto the dock. If a mechanical issue cancels your day, we find a
                replacement vessel or issue a full refund — same day. If your host does not show, we are on the
                phone within fifteen minutes arranging an alternative. We do not hide behind terms and conditions
                when our guests need us to act. That is the BoatHire24 standard and it is non-negotiable.
