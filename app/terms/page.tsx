            facilitate direct agreements between Hosts and Guests.
          </P>

          <P>
            When you request or confirm a booking through BoatHire24, you are entering into a direct agreement
            with the Host for the charter of their vessel. BoatHire24 facilitates this agreement but is not a
            party to it. The Host is solely responsible for the vessel, its seaworthiness, the skipper&apos;s
            qualifications, and the delivery of the charter experience.
          </P>
          <P><strong style={{ color: '#f4f4f2' }}>Payment</strong></P>
          <P>
            Payment is processed securely by Stripe at the time of booking confirmation. The total amount
            displayed at checkout includes the charter fee and a platform service fee of{' '}
            <strong style={{ color: '#f4f4f2' }}>15%</strong>. The service fee is non-refundable except where

            Hosts receive <strong style={{ color: '#f4f4f2' }}>85%</strong> of the charter fee for each completed
            booking. BoatHire24 retains a 15% platform commission. Payouts are processed via Stripe Connect
            and typically arrive in your bank account within 7 days of the completed charter date.
            Hosts must complete Stripe&apos;s identity verification to receive payouts.
          </P>
          <P><strong style={{ color: '#f4f4f2' }}>Host responsibilities</strong></P>

            In the event of adverse weather conditions that make sailing unsafe, the skipper may cancel

          <P>
            Hosts are solely responsible for the safety of their vessel, the competence of their crew,
            and compliance with all maritime safety regulations. BoatHire24 does not inspect vessels and
            makes no warranty regarding their condition or seaworthiness, notwithstanding our verification
            processes which are provided as a good-faith service only.
